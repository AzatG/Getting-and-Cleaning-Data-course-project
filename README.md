# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-course-project

 Aim of the project was to prepare data tidy form that can be used in later analysis
 
 1. First I downloaded the data and extracted zip file on directory. 
 2. After uploading data  on R it was merged with each other (dataX, dataY and subjects)
 3. Column names were given properly
 4. Activity labels were attached to each row by activity_id
 5. Data with mean, standard deviation and activity labels were subsetted in new data file
 6. From  new file  data with aggregated mean by activity labels and subject was aggregated

 Detailed script, codebook are attached as well.
