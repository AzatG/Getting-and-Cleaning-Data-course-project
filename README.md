# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-course-project

 Aim of the project was to download data and format it in tidy data that can be used in later analysis
 Initially I downloaded the data and extracted zip file on directory that was used in later preparation
 After uploading data  on R it was merged with each other and column names were given properly
 DataX DataY and subjects of train and test data were merged in one file
 according to subject (activity_id) it was labeled with activities mentioned in activity_labels.txt

 in the Next step data with mean, standard deviation and activity labels were subsetted in new data file
 from this file new data with aggregated mean by activity labels for each column was created as tidy data

 Detailed script, codebook are attached as well
